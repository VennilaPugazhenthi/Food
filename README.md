# Food
This App was created using React Native to search for restaurants using Yelp API. I followed the tutorial in this [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15707010#overview) to make this app. 

###### To run
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the directory of the cloned repository.
3. Run the following command:
  `npm start` 
  (Make sure you have nodejs, react native, and expo-cli installed before running this command. You can use this [link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment- setup) to install those.)
